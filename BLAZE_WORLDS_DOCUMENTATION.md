## 🔧 Customization Guide

### Adding New Biomes
```javascript
const CUSTOM_BIOME = {
    name: 'Volcanic',
    baseHeight: 40,
    variance: 15,
    color: new THREE.Color(0x8b0000),
    fogColor: new THREE.Color(0xff4500),
    treeChance: 0.0,
    grassChance: 0.0,
    specialBlocks: [BLOCKS.LAVA, BLOCKS.OBSIDIAN]
};
```

### Modifying World Generation
```javascript
// Adjust noise scales for different terrain
CONFIG.BIOME_SCALE = 0.003;  // Larger biomes
CONFIG.TERRAIN_SCALE = 0.01; // Smoother terrain
CONFIG.CAVE_SCALE = 0.08;    // Smaller caves
```

### Performance Tuning
```javascript
// For lower-end devices
CONFIG.RENDER_DISTANCE = 4;  // Reduce view distance
CONFIG.CHUNK_SIZE = 8;       // Smaller chunks
CONFIG.LOD_DISTANCES = [25, 50, 100]; // Aggressive LOD
```
