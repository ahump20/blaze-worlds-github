# 🏆 Blaze Intelligence Vision Engine

## Championship-Level Video Analysis Platform

The Vision Engine is the revolutionary core of Blaze Intelligence's sports analysis platform, combining biomechanical precision with behavioral intelligence to identify and develop championship-caliber athletes.

## 🎯 Mission

Transform sports performance analysis by capturing not just what athletes do, but **who they are** - reading the micro-expressions of grit, the body language of champions, and the neural patterns that separate good from great.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Dual-Stream Intelligence
- **Biomechanical Analysis**: 3D skeletal tracking with MediaPipe Pose
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Micro-expression detection with MediaPipe Face Mesh
- **Mind-Body Synthesis**: Revolutionary fusion of physical and mental metrics

### Championship Metrics
- **Composure & Resilience Score**: Proprietary algorithm measuring performance under pressure
- **Clutch Factor**: Real-time assessment of critical moment execution
- **Championship Readiness**: Comprehensive evaluation against elite standards

### Sport-Specific Analysis
- Baseball (batting, pitching, fielding)
- Football (quarterback, receiver, defensive)
- Basketball (shooting, dribbling, defensive stance)

### Composure & Resilience Score Algorithm
```javascript
// Variance in facial landmarks during pressure events
const calculateComposureResilience = (landmarks, pressureLevel) => {
  const variance = calculateLandmarkVariance(landmarks);
  const stability = 100 - (variance * pressureLevel);

  // Championship athletes maintain < 15% variance
  // under 80+ pressure situations
  return Math.max(0, Math.min(100, stability));
};
```

### Clutch Factor Calculation
```javascript
// Performance in critical moments (±30 frames of pressure events)
const calculateClutchFactor = (criticalFrames) => {
  const biomechanicalScore = average(criticalFrames.efficiency);
  const behavioralScore = average(criticalFrames.composure);

  // Weight behavioral higher in pressure situations
  return biomechanicalScore * 0.4 + behavioralScore * 0.6;
};
```
